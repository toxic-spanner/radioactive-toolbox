# Radioactive Toolbox

The *Radioactive Toolbox* is a framework and engine for complex redstone creations in Minecraft. The toolbox can be used as the backbone for a creation via its component-based extensibile design, or simply as a set of utilities for simplifying operations.

The toolbox is written in [*MCA*](https://github.com/toxic-spanners/MCA) (_M_ine_c_raft _A_ssembly Language), which is compiled down to command blocks and redstone circuitry. This repository contains the source MCA, as well as compilation scripts and the latest version of the compiled script.
