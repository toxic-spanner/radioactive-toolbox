# Radioactive Toolbox

> ***The toolbox is still under heavy development, and use in a production environment is not recommended.***

The **Radioactive Toolbox** is a framework and engine for complex redstone creations in Minecraft. The toolbox can be used as the backbone for a creation via its component-based extensibile design, or simply as a set of utilities for simplifying operations.

The toolbox is written in [MCA](https://github.com/toxic-spanners/MCA) (Minecraft Assembly Language), which is compiled down to command blocks and redstone circuitry. This repository contains the source MCA, as well as compilation scripts and the latest version of the compiled script.
